# A+ Languages Component Library

This component library follows the **Atomic Design** methodology to organize UI components into clear, reusable groups.

## Atomic Design Structure

Our components are organized into the following categories:

### Atoms

The basic building blocks of our application:
- Button
- Logo
- LanguageFlag
- ScrollTopButton

Atoms are the smallest functional UI components that can't be broken down further without losing their meaning.

### Molecules

Combinations of atoms that work together as a unit:
- LanguageSelector

Molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.

### Organisms

Complex UI sections composed of atoms, molecules, and other organisms:
- Header
- AboutSection
- ClassesSection
- CtaSection
- HeroSection
- StatsSection

Organisms are relatively complex UI components that form distinct sections of the interface.

### Templates

Page-level objects that place components into a layout:
- (To be implemented as needed)

### Utilities

Components that provide functionality rather than UI:
- LangAttributeSetter

## Usage Guidelines

When creating new components:

1. **Determine the type** - Consider where your component fits in the atomic design hierarchy
2. **Follow naming conventions** - Use PascalCase for component names
3. **Create stories** - Document all possible states and variants
4. **Include documentation** - Add JSDoc comments and meaningful descriptions

For more detailed information about each component, explore the documentation in each section.
